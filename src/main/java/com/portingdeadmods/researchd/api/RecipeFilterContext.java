/**

 * reads the current frame and filters out recipes blocked for that team.
 * <p>
 * Pushers (in core): {@code BoundTickingBlockEntityMixin} for every ticking BE,
 * {@code CraftingMenuMixin} for player crafting. Addons may push their own
 * frames for code paths that don't tick through a BE.
 * <p>
 * Addons that need to filter recipe lookups which bypass the vanilla
 * {@link net.minecraft.world.item.crafting.RecipeManager} (e.g. mods with their own cached recipe
 * finders) should not re-implement the blocking rules. Instead they mixin into the foreign finder
 * and call {@link #isBlocked(RecipeHolder)} per result, and, if that finder caches a prebuilt
 * structure, scope its cache key with {@link #scopedKey(Object)} so each team keeps its own entry.
